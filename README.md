In the era of social media, the need for a well-organized and efficient database system is paramount. Social media platforms generate vast amounts of data daily, ranging from user interactions and content uploads to trends and preferences. Managing and analyzing this data is crucial for enhancing user experience, providing personalized content, and improving overall platform performance.

## About

Welcome to the Social Media Database Project! This project aims to create a robust structure for a social media database that can seamlessly connect to a frontend interface. We manage the data of multiple users, including their followers, interests, and various public activities on the Social media platform.

- Follower System: Track and manage user followers.
- Interests: Store user interests to enhance content recommendations.
- Public Activity: Capture post likes, comments, comment likes, hashtag follows, bookmarks, and more.
- Media Storage: Save images and videos in their true storage form using URLs.

## Power BI Dashboard
