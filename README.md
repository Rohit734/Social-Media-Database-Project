## About

Welcome to the Social Media Database Project! This project aims to create a robust structure for a social media database that can
seamlessly connect to a frontend interface. We manage the data of multiple users, including their followers, interests, and various 
public activities on the social media platform.


## Project Objectives

1. Design and implement a robust database schema that efficiently stores social media-related data.
2. Develop SQL queries to establish clear connections between different activities on the social media platform.
3. Create a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key insights derived from the database.
4. Provide detailed analytics on user engagement, content interactions, and media consumption patterns.

### Features:

- User Management: Store and retrieve information about users.
- Follower System: Track and manage user followers.
- Interests: Store user interests to enhance content recommendations.
- Public Activity: Capture post likes, comments, comment likes, hashtag follows, bookmarks, and more.
- Media Storage: Save images and videos in their true storage form using URLs.
